# TorchServe library​

## ​OpenAI GPT models: 

These models are not directly affected by the ShellTorch vulnerabilities, as they do not rely on TorchServe for deployment.​

### Oligo

​Google BERT library: BERT is a separate natural language processing model developed by Google and does not utilize TorchServe.​
​TensorFlow models: TensorFlow is a different machine learning framework that does not depend on TorchServe for model serving.​
Therefore, the ShellTorch vulnerabilities specifically impact the TorchServe library.​
